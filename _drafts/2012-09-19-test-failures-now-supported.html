<div class="section">    
    <p>
        Up until yesterday we had no way to spot a failed test. I'm referring
        not to a failure such as an HTML validation test finding errors but a test
        that fails to run at all.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Some full-site HTML validation tests were stalling on a small number of tests.
        In particular there was a ~150 page site where the HTML validation tests
        for 3 URLs were never completing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was clear, after running the relevant URLs manually through the HTML
        validator, that these were pages that could not be validated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The URLs for which test were never completing were pages were advertising 
        themselves as being <code>utf-8</code> encoded but which included
        character references that did not map to Unicode; not something I'd 
        previously encountered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Tests that cannot run are now picked up as failures. So far this covers
        cases where the HTML validator cannot perform any validation.
    </p>

    <p>
        When running a test you can now see another bar below those that list
        the number of queued, in-progress and completed tests to show 
        the number of tests that failed. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        Once the full-site test has finished (or
        has been cancelled if you don't fancy waiting), the results page for
        a failed test will detail why the test could not run.
    </p>
