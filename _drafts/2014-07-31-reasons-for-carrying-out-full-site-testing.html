        <a href="https://simplytestable.com">Simply Testable</a> offers one-click full site HTML validation,
        CSS validtion, JavaScript static analysis and broken link checking.
    </p>

    <p>
        I sometimes get asked, both by users of the service and people I talk to about my work,
        some common questions regarding the need to run tests against the entirety of a site.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why do I have to test the whole site, can't I just &hellip;
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>test the homepage</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>test just the first few pages</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>test only those pages that I've recently changed</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        &hellip; surely that'll highlight some common issues?
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll point out that Simply Testable lets you test either just a specific single page
        or your entire site and nowhere in-between for a very good reason.
    </p>

    <p>
        The single reason: you don't know what is wrong until you've checked what is wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll explain that now in a little more detail.

    <h2>A comparison to unit testing</h2>

    <p>
        I have a background in software development, am very familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>
        and run unit tests against code on an almost daily basis.

        People who professionally build or test websites are either very familiar with unit testing
        or have a good understanding of the concept.
    </p>

    <p>
        It therefore seems fitting to make a comparison to unit testing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's go with a real example. You develop an application that, for the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/webignition/app.simplytestable.com/jobs/31155065">current public CI build</a>,
        has a set of 1048 unit tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        It takes about 5 minutes to run these tests on your local development machine. A five-minute feedback loop
        for the code, test, code, test cycle really impedes productivity such that you get nowhere quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        You instead go for a cycle of code, run specific test, code, run specific test. The specific test takes
        48ms to run, adding effectively no overhead and no impediment and you get things done a lot more quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you're done fixing a bug or adding a feature you run your specific test again, see that it
        passes, commit, push and make a coffee.
        You were working on a very specific area of the codebase, totally unrelated to anything else, so all should be fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        And you think all is fine until the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/webignition/app.simplytestable.com/jobs/20268734">CI build fails</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only then do you run the full set of local tests, fix the issue and vow to never ever push changes without
        running the full test suite. This is by no means the first time you've done this and, you tell yourself,
        this is certainly going to be the last time you push code without first running the full test suite.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the reason you want to run a full-site test when testing your website. If you don't test everything,
        you're not identifying all the possible faults.
    </p>

    <p>
        Or, to put it another way, if you are able to run only a subset of tests, you will miss something.

    <h2>Frameworks: one change here fixes (or breaks) things everywhere</h2>

    <p>
        Web frameworks are great, providing a solution to known problems such as creating and authenticating
        users or preventing XSRF attacks in forms and letting you focus on your application-specific matters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Somewhere in your web framework is a templating engine; a means to squidge together a set of raw data
        and a view into a lovely chunk of meaningful HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your lovely templating engine will have some means of letting you form web pages from a set of
        bare templates and a collection of various common bits and pieces that often show up on many pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The common bits and pieces are great - you have to write each just the once and then it's correct and
        working across your whole site.
    </p>

    <p>
        Found a bug in your common navigation widget? Fix the widget, save the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Found a bug in your date picker widget? Fix the widget, save the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your navigation widget can be found on every single page and so you know from
        testing just one page that your fix has worked everywhere. Easy work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your date picker widget is available on some, but not all, pages. You'd tested the page where someone can
        pick their vacation dates to check availability on your campsite. You tested the page where someone makes
        their booking. The bug you had with the date picker, you confirm, is definitely fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
        You didn't know that the same date picker widget is used to book visits to the campsite's on-site zoo (two
        goats, a zebra and a giraffe).
    </p>

    <p>
        But you've never worked on the admin site of things so you didn't know to check that the
        date picker used to modify a booking date on behalf of someone else is working. Which it isn't, which
        is causing frustration for Sarah when she tries to update the booking for a trip from the local school.
    </p>

    <p>
        A change in one place can fix an issue in many places or might cause an issue in many places.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't test everything, you might miss something.
    </p>
