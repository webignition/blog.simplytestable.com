        I'm preparing to run ads for <a href="https://simplytestable.com/">Simply Testable</a> that feature
        coupon codes offering discounts.
    </p>

    <p>
        I needed to build in the ability to accept discount codes. This, as always, required a spot of upfront
        learning and a careful redesign of the account creation pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most obvious solution - to add a 'discount code' field to the sign up page - is non-ideal through
        being distracting and disappointing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's how I worked my way to finding a better solution.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Easy, just add a 'discount code' field</h3>

    <p>
        I've used the Internet a bit for the past few years. I know how these things work.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to allow people to use discount codes, you add a 'discount code' field to your sign up page:
    </p>

    <p>
        People hear your ad on a podcast. The jot down the discount code, rush to your site and enter the discount code
        when creating an account.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Not that easy</h3>

    <p>
        One quick new field later and &hellip; tada! &hellip; profit! Converting new users into paying users has never
        been so easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Except the user has to make sure to jot down or remember the discount code. And the user has to enter the
        discount code. Correctly, without transposing any characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Except that this is one more field for the user to have to fill in. Adding a third user-fillable field to a form
        having only two user-fillable fields is a big increase. A bump in cognitive load is not unexpected.
    </p>

    <p>
        And users without a discount code are abruptly struck in the face. Discount code? I can get this more cheaply?
        <em>Others</em> are getting this more cheaply and <em>I am not</em>? Why don't I have a discount code? Where
        can I get a discount code?
    </p>

    <p>
        For users without a discount code, focus can shift quickly away from creating an account to resolving the need
        to acquire a price reduction.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>I'll just hunt down a discount code, how hard can that be?</h3>

    <p>
        I'll go to Google, enter [Simply Testable discount code] and I'll be on my way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Oh, here we go. First result looks promising, let's see what that is. Nope, no discount code, just a
