    <p>
        I'm preparing to run ads for <a href="https://simplytestable.com/">Simply Testable</a> that feature
        coupon codes offering discounts.
    </p>

    <p>
        I needed to build in the ability to accept discount codes. This, as always, required a spot of upfront
        learning and a careful redesign of the account creation pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most obvious solution - to add a 'discount code' field to the sign up page - is non-ideal through
        being distracting and disappointing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's how I worked my way to finding a better solution.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Easy, just add a 'discount code' field</h3>

    <p>
        I've used the Internet a bit for the past few years. I know how these things work.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to allow people to use discount codes, you add a 'discount code' field to your sign up page:
    </p>

    <p>
        Someone hears your ad on a podcast, jots down the discount code, rushes to your site and enters the discount code
        when creating an account.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Not that easy</h3>

    <p>
        One quick new field later and &hellip; tada! &hellip; profit! Converting new users into paying users has never
        been so easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Except the user has to make sure to jot down or remember the discount code. And the user has to enter the
        discount code. Correctly, without transposing any characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Except that this is one more field for the user to fill in. Adding a third user-fillable field to a form
        having only two user-fillable fields is a big increase. A bump in cognitive load is not unexpected.
    </p>

    <p>
        And users without a discount code are abruptly struck in the face. Discount code? I can get this more cheaply?
        <em>Others</em> are getting this more cheaply and <em>I am not</em>? Why don't I have a discount code? Where
        can I get a discount code?
    </p>

    <p>
        For users without a discount code, focus can shift quickly away from creating an account to resolving the need
        to acquire a price reduction.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Distraction (I'll just hunt down a discount code, how hard can that be?)</h3>

    <p>
        I'll go to Google, enter [Simply Testable discount code] and I'll be on my way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Oh, here we go. First result looks promising, let's see what that is. Nope, no discount code, just a
        blog post about <a href="">accepting discount codes without distraction or disappointment</a>. Too meta.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ok, the second result should surely do it. Nope, that's a page in simplified Chinese that happens
        to mention both [Simply Testable] and [discount code] but not in a related context. Surprising
        amounts of blinking text but not what I was looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hmm, how about I change my search terms a bit. That'll work better with a cup of tea, let me sort
        that out first.
    </p>

    <p>
        &hellip; 10 minutes pass &hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
        Off to the afternoon project planning meeting. I've still got half a cup of coffee left which is nice.
    </p>

    <p>
        &hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
        Distraction. The user is no longer focused on creating an account. Add to a form in any way that encourages
        the user to leave your site and you reduce the chance of converting that user into a paying customer.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Disappointment (I guess I'll have to pay the full price)</h3>

    <p>
        You've been using a SaaS product for free, perhaps a limited demo, and you've decided that the value provided
        by the service is worth exchanging for some of your cash.
    </p>

    <p>
        You're at the sign up page and you're sure that &pound;19 per month is a fair exchange for what the service
        can do for you. You're happy to pay.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ooh, I can enter a discount code? I'll go to Google, enter [Simply Testable discount code] and I'll be on my way.
    </p>

    <p>
        &hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
        You can't find a discount code. You mentally block out the discount code field and begrudgingly decide to
        pay the full price.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just minutes ago you were happy to pay. The price asked for the value provided seemed fair. You still need
        to pay but you're not as happy to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
        You now feel that the service could have been bought at a lower monthly price. You're being charged more than
        you should be. Regardless of the fact that just minutes ago you were happy to pay the price being asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some people, on not being able to find a discount code, will change their mind. Others will continue but
        reluctantly. Some will continue with as much enthusiasm as before.
    </p>

    <p>
        What you don't get is all new users proceeding to create an account and of the ones that do, not all are as
        happy to do so.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Accepting discount codes with no discount code field</h3>

    <p>
        The addition of a discount field is non-ideal. It leads to increased cognitive load, distraction and disappointment.
    </p>

    <p>
        We need a way of accepting discount codes without having a discount code field.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thankfully there is a simple way to achieve this: don't promote discount codes and instead promote landing page
        URLs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't encourage users to go to example.com and enter discount code "foo" for 20% off their order. Encourage
        users to go to example.com/foo for 20% off their order.
    </p>

    <p>
        After all, every good promotion deserves a good (or at least unique) landing page, so why not take advantage of
        what you can do when users reach your landing page?
    </p>

    <p>
        The landing page can set a cookie that holds the discount code. The page that would otherwise include a discount code
        field reads the cookie and clearly informs the user of the discount they are getting.
    </p>

    <p>
        The bad process (using a discount code field):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Encourage user to visit example.com and use discount code "foo" for 20% off
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                User visits example.com and, in time, proceeds to the checkout or sign up page
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                User enters discount code "foo"
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                User is informed that they now get 20% off their order
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The good process (using a discount code cookie):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Encourage user to visit example.com/foo for 20% off
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                User visits example.com/foo and, in time, proceeds to the checkout or sign up page
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                User is informed that they now get 20% off their order
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
