Simply Testable Updates #39: Your Account Page Mostly Complete
May 15, 2013

You're receiving this email because you joined Simply Testable's updates list.

This is the 39th of weekly progress updates on the development of
http://simplytestable.com, a brand new automated web frontend testing service
providing one-click testing for your entire site.

I returned late last week from a week-long vacation in the Scottish Highlands.

Highlights from this week:
* Your account page mostly complete
* Invalid in-markup content type bug fixed

## Your account page mostly done
Work is complete on the 'your account' page. I say that it is mostly done as the 
changes have not yet been deployed live as the changes were completed just a few 
minutes ago.

Before long you'll be able to click on your email address that you see at the 
top-right when signed in (just next to the sign out button) to take you to your 
account page.

From there you can change your account email address and password and see the 
details of your account plan.

Once paid plans are in place you will also be able to subscribe to a paid plan as 
well as upgrade or downgrade between the plans.

## Invalid in-markup content type bug fixed
Your web server can (and really should) return a Content-Type header along with the 
content it is serving. This tells web clients how to interpret the content they're 
being given.

If you can't have the correct HTTP headers set, you can instead use a
http-equiv (http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/meta.http-equiv.content-type.html) 
element in the of your HTML document. Such meta elements are, for a set of defined 
values, interpreted as being equivalent to HTTP headers.

In short, a <meta> http-equiv element can be used to override a specific HTTP 
header, telling a browser (or other web client) to pay attention to the value 
provided by your element and to ignore that provided in the HTTP headers.

If you can't change your web server to return the correct Content-Type header, 
you can instead set a element to define the content type.

Some people or machines do this but do it wrongly.

One specific product that appears to be an enterprise content management system 
does it wrongly and produces an invalid element denoting the content type. Instead 
of providing a "text/html" content type it prefers to instead to use simply 
"textml". This is invalid and was causing the odd HTML validation test to fail.

You can now safely use an invalid content-type element if you like and we'll simply 
ignore it.

## Upcoming development
As soon as the 'your account' page changes have been deployed live I'm going to 
start enforcing limits on the totally-free full-site tests that can be run. If you 
are signed in this will have no effect on you.

I'll then move on to implementing paid plans and integrating with the Stripe 
payment handling service.

As always, if you'd like to see web testing you find boring handled automatically 
for you, add a suggestion or vote up those that interest you
(https://simplytestable.uservoice.com/forums/175588-tell-us-what-to-make-/filters/top).
This really helps.
