Simply Testable Updates #66: New Dashboard Was Released, HTML Validator Improvements On The Way
November 20, 2013

You're receiving this email because you joined Simply Testable's updates list.

This is the 66th of weekly progress updates on the development of
http://simplytestable.com, your professional new automated web frontend testing 
service providing one-click testing for your entire site.

Over the past week I launched the new test dashboard and test history pages and 
started work on improvements to the HTML validator.

## New Test Dashboard Went Live
I mentioned in last week's newsletter that the new test dashboard and test 
history would be released not long after the newsletter was sent out.

This didn't quite come to be but the release was made last Thursday.  Take a 
look at:

## HTML Validator Improvements On The Way
I've been re-writing how Simply Testable interacts with our copy of the W3C HTML
 validator to make it easier to independently update the validator and to 
facilitate the testing of password-protected pages.

Keeping our copy of the W3C HTML validator up to date is not as straightforward 
as it could be for reasons I won't go into as they're oh so very, very technical. 
Ok, I will go in to some detail but not much.

Our copy of the W3C HTML validator came from an official Ubuntu package. At the 
time this made sense - sudo apt-get install w3c-markup-validator - as it's dead 
easy; a one-liner. I subsequently noticed that the official package wasn't 
particularly well kept up-to-date with changes to the source code. Not good. 
If the people behind the W3C HTML validator fix a bug I want to be able to make
 use of such changes as soon as is practical.

I've been working on a installation/update script for the W3C HTML validator to 
install and/or update from just a single command. On a test machine this works 
well.

I've also bypassed the need to run the HTML validator as a web service, instead 
accessing it solely from the command line. This took a bit of poking around and 
trial and error to see what did and what didn't work. At many times I was 
utterly convinced it couldn't be done and many times I proved myself wrong.

By not having to send a request through Apache to the validator and then the 
response out of the validator and back to Apache, we remove the overhead 
involved in Apache processing the both the request and response. Yay! Faster 
HTML validation and less server resource intensive.

By calling the validator from the command line and passing it the content to 
validate we move one step nearer to being able to test password-protected pages.

## Upcoming Development
I don't see much in the way of new development over the next week as I'm 
somewhat busy with a different project. Nevertheless, there will be some time 
to work on finishing off the HTML validator improvements.

As always, if you'd like to see web testing you find boring handled automatically 
for you, add a suggestion or vote up those that interest you

This really helps.
