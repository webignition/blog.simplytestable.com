Simply Testable Updates #38: Stripe Integration Investigation, Account Plans, Your Account Page
May 1, 2013

You're receiving this email because you joined Simply Testable's updates list.

This is the 38th of weekly progress updates on the development of
http://simplytestable.com, a brand new automated web frontend testing service
providing one-click testing for your entire site.

Highlights from this week:
* Stripe (payment handling) integration investigation
* Initial account plans created
* Your account page progress
* Account plan limits not yet implemented


## Stripe (payment handling) integration investigation
I planned from the outset to use Stripe (https://stripe.com/) for handling payments 
and was lucky enough to get accepted to the UK beta of the service.

I've spent many hours this week reading through the Stripe API documentation to 
understand what is needed of Simply Testable to associate your account with a paid 
subscription.

As I'd hoped, integrating with Stripe is amazingly straightforward.

## Initial account plans created
The majority of this past week was spent investigating what types of account plan 
could be created and how these could be implemented.

Yesterday and today I deployed to the production server the changes required to 
support account plans. I then created two initial plans (public and basic) and 
added all existing users to the basic plan.

The public plan is not one you'll ever see mentioned on the site. This is a special 
plan for the totally free tests you can currently run without being signed in. This 
limits the number of URLs that can be tested for a site, limits the number of times 
a site can be tested per month and limits the number of types of test you can run 
at one time.

All registered users are currently subscribed to the basic plan. This is a free plan 
and always will be. Currently there are no limits but this will change once paid 
plans are introduced.

For the first X days after the introduction of paid plans, all existing and new 
users will have the option to upgrade for free to a year-long paid subscription. 
I'm not yet sure what 'X' will be but am currently thinking somewhere around 30.

## Your account page progress
As far as your account goes you can sign in, sign out and reset your password if 
you've lost it.

Account creation (http://blog.simplytestable.com/account-creation-live/) was 
launched back on 9 November 2012 with a minimal set of features as there wasn't 
really anything you could do with your account.

That will be changing over the coming weeks with the addition of paid plans.

In preparation for this, the 'your account' page is under development to initially 
introduce some basic features such as changing your email address and password.

When paid plans are introduced, additional features will be added to allow you to 
change the plan you subscribe to.

## Account plan limits not yet implemented
Account plans can have limits, such as restricting you to checking only the first 
10 URLs of a site instead of the entire site.

These limits exist and are defined for the current account plans but nothing has 
yet been put in place to enforce them.

I expect this to be the case until the 'your account' page is ready.

## Upcoming development
On Friday I'm off on vacation to Scotland for a week. I don't expect to make much 
more progress for the rest of this week and certainly won't be making any progress 
until I return back to work on Monday 13 May.

Work will then continue on the 'your account' page followed by implementing the 
enforcement of account limits.

As always, if you'd like to see web testing you find boring handled automatically 
for you, add a suggestion or vote up those that interest you
(https://simplytestable.uservoice.com/forums/175588-tell-us-what-to-make-/filters/top).
This really helps.
