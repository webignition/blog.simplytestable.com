    <h3>The need for CSS validation options (controlling the validator)</h3>
    <p>
        I've recently been adding some options to CSS validation tests to make the
        tests more useful. Or, depending on your perspective, to make CSS validation
        useful where it previously was not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Across a short series of blog posts, I'd like to look now at why CSS 
        validation options are needed, the range of  options I considered, where I 
        got the options from and how I decided on which of these to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time I shall look at the need for CSS validation options to turn
        CSS validation output into something that's of much greater value.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS validation options are essential. Not  merely useful or a nice-to-have 
        feature. They're essential. Without any control over the CSS validator, 
        the default output has very little value.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core purpose of Simply Testable is to automate away common, generic
        front end web testing aspects allowing you to focus on those aspects of
        testing that are specific to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the output of such automated tests is a pain for you to process you're
        not really gaining much if anything. That's where we are with CSS validation.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS validation pains</h3>
    <p>
        You're likely to link to third-party CSS resources such as <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> themes
        or the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap framework</a>. Perhaps you'll host copies of these
        yourself, however many of you will link to those provided by common content
        delivery networks such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Google's Hosted Libraries</a> or 
        <a href="http://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        What you don't care about is the validity of the CSS supplied by popular
        third-party libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Invalid rules in Twitter Bootstrap's CSS are probably present for a very good 
        reason. You can have invalid CSS that does not break anything. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You could be using vendor extensions to take advantage in specific browsers 
        of upcoming CSS features yet to be formally specified. CSS allows for
        vendor extensions in this manner, however the CSS validator raises such issues as either
        warnings or errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often you don't care about vendor extension issues and
        the presence of vendor extension errors in validation output distracts you
        from matters that are actually important.
    </p>
    <h3>Focusing on what matters to you</h3>
    <p>
        CSS validity is not an absolute requirement. Invalid CSS does not
        implicitly mean that there is an error that must be addressed.
    </p>    
    <p>
        CSS rules that are not understood by a CSS processor will be ignored.
        If some CSS is invalid the world will not end but you might find some 
        presentational aspects are not as you expect.
    </p>
    <p>
        The importance of examining CSS validity lies in being able to ensure
        that the CSS you write yourself is correct as far as you intended and to 
        ensure that any unusual behaviour in a given browser is due to that browser
        being odd and not due to your potentially invalid CSS making the browser
        appear to behave oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to be able to exert control over CSS validation to ignore those
        aspects of CSS about which we don't care such that we can focus on
        those aspects that actually matter.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next in this series I'll look at the validation options I considered
        and what I chose to implement.
