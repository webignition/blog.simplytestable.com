        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&id=c51eea7964">seventh updates newsletter</a> went out today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Highlights in preparing for next week's private alpha release:
    </p>
<ul>    
	<li>
            <p>
                I ordered a <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex4">EX4 dedicated server</a> from Hetzner:
            </p>
        </li>        
	<li>
            <p>
                Reduced the time to load the details for an in-progress ~600 page test from 
    40 seconds to 2 seconds, then later to 1 second
            </p>
        </li>   
	<li>
            <p>
                Added HTTP caching headers for non-changing pages such as test results, 
    reducing page load time from about 4 seconds to 0.5 seconds
            </p>
        </li>   
	<li>
            <p>
                Rewrote how test tasks are assigned to workers to prevent in-progress tests 
    from blocking new tests from starting  
            </p>
        </li>          
</ul>

    
    <p>
        Expect the next in a week from now, September 12 2012.
