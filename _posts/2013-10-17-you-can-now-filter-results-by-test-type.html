<div class="section section-first">
    <p>
        See that list of error counts towards the right-hand side above?
    </p>
    <p>
        That was just a simple plain list until a few minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
        That simple plain list is now a set of clickable links, letting you
        filter test results by the types of test that were selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can now list all tests that were run, or just HTML validation
        tests, or just CSS validation tests, or just JavaScript static analysis
        tests or just link integrity tests.
    </p>
