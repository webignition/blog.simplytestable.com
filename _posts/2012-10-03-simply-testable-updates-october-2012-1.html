        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&id=f640ebc4a3">eleventh updates newsletter</a> went out today.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week saw performance improvements in preparation for today's <a href="http://simplytestable.com">public alpha release</a> release:
    </p>
<ul>    
	<li>
            <p>
                Timeouts during tests are now caught; if the HTTP request to retrieve a web page for HTML validation times out, the test in question is marked as failed
            </p>
        </li>        
	<li>
            <p>
                ATOM and RSS feed URLs listed in robots.txt as the sitemap URL are now recognised, allowing URLs to be more easily collected for many WordPress, Blogspot and Blogger sites
            </p>
        </li>   
	<li>
            <p>
                404 (not found) and 500 (internal server error) errors are now presented on nice error pages, I also get emailed a stack trace so that I know when something breaks and can then at least try to fix it    
            </p>
        </li>           
</ul>
    
    <p>
        Expect the next in a week from now, October 10 2012.
