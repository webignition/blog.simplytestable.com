<div class="section">
    <p>
        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&id=5c86a943e3">ninth updates newsletter</a> went out today.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week saw improvements to the <a href="http://alpha1.simplytestable.com">first alpha release</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Highlights from the newsletter:
    </p>
<ul>    
	<li>
            <p>
                RSS feed support: for sites that have no sitemap.xml, URLs are retrieved from the RSS feed (if present)
            </p>
        </li>        
	<li>
            <p>
                Graceful test failure handling: URLs for which HTML validation cannot happen are marked as failed and no longer hold up the rest of the full-site test
            </p>
        </li>   
	<li>
            <p>
                Progress and results page improvements: these pages load almost always for larger (1500+ URL) sites, previously they failed most of the time    
            </p>
        </li>           
</ul>
    
    <p>
        Expect the next in a week from now, September 26 2012.
