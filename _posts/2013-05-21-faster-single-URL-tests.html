<div class="section">
    <p>
        Running a single-URL test just got faster!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Single-URL tests previously followed the same execution process as full-site
        tests which goes something like this:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Create new test
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Prepare test (collect URLs, create test tasks for each URL)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Start assigning out test tasks to workers
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        The carrying out of step 2 is deferred to an background processing queue.
        This means it is carried out some time after step 1. It might be quite soon
        after step 1 or it might be a while after step 1.
    </p>  
    
    <p>
        Some tests take a long time to prepare (such as those with thousands of URLs to
        examine). If we didn't defer this to a background processing queue, you
        could be sitting around waiting for a long time for your browser to load
        the test progress page. A really long time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This results in a short delay between steps 1 and 2. The delay is an unavoidable
        side effect of being able to give you immediate progress details as soon as
        you start a new test.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is the process that full-site tests follow. Single-URL tests initially
        followed the same process because it worked, there was no immediate
        need to change it and there were more important changes to address.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Now that we're moving towards the introduction of paid plans, the need
        for improved performance and for a higher overall product quality increases.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Single-URL tests now use this process:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Create and prepare test
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Start assigning out test tasks to workers
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>  
    
    <p>
        There is no longer any delay between a test being created and a test being
        prepared.        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With single-URL tests the time required to collect the URLs to be tested
        and to prepare the test tasks is negligible - we already know the one and only URL
        to be tested and we already know the types of test you want to run.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This shaves off a few seconds from how long it takes to run a single-URL test
        making each just a little bit faster.
    </p>
