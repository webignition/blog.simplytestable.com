    <p>
        The private alpha release is now available: <a href="http://alpha1.simplytestable.com/">http://alpha1.simplytestable.com/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can run full-site HTML validation tests on any site that has a sitemap.xml file; it's from the sitemap that
        the URLs to be tested are retrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a few known issues which translate into matters I'll be addressing this coming week:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                the progress and results for large sites (2000+ URLs) will tend to not
                load more often than not
            </p>
            <p>
                individual tests (that are part of a full-site test) that fail will
                tend to prevent the rest of the test from progressing
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are some improvements to be worked on also, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                adding support for compressed sitemaps
            </p>
            <p>
                retrieving URLs from a site's RSS feed if not sitemap is present
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
