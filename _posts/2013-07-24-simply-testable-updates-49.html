        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&id=616710d839">49th updates newsletter</a> went out today.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This week I ran lots of analysis to identify the most common specific
        HTML validation errors and the most common types of error with the
        aim of generating help pages to provide explanations of, and possible
        solutions for, the HTML validation errors you may encounter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Expect the next newsletter a week from now on July 31.
