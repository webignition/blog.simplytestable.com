        Since the introduction of CSS validation two weeks ago, any new full-site
        test ran both HTML and CSS validation for all URLs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not giving you any choice in the matter of which type of test to run
        allow me to get CSS validation released more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The obvious downside of this is that any given full-site test will take
        longer than needed if you want to carry out only HTML validation or CSS validation
        but not both.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Today a change was introduced allowing you to choose the type of tests to run.
        When starting a new test, you are now presented with two simple checkboxes
        allowing you to select either HTML validation, CSS validation or both.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the first step towards offering you more control over what your
        tests cover. In the future this can be built upon to add more fine-grained 
        control such as choosing to ignore errors relating to vendor-specific CSS
        extensions.
    </p>
