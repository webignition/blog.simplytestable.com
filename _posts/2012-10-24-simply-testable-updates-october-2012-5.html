        Highlights:
    </p>

<ul>    
	<li>
            <p>
                The service copes with capacity much better than it used to
            </p>
        </li>        
	<li>
            <p>
		I wrote today about how you can <a href="/how-to-test-a-local-site/" target="_blank" style="color: #0088cc;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">use Simply Testable to test a local site</a>
            </p>
        </li>
	<li>
            <p>
		Account creation is mostly complete locally. Tests you start when logged in are private to you.
            </p>
        </li>           
	<li>
            <p>
		When retrieving URLs from compressed sitemaps, we no longer care what Content-Type accompanies the sitemap; HTTP headers lie.
            </p>
        </li>                   
</ul>
    
    <p>
        Expect the next in a week from now, November 7 2012.
