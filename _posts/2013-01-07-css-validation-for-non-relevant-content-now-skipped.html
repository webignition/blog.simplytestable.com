    <p>
        If you have non-HTML URLs in your sitemap, such as URLs for PDFs, HTML
        tests for such URLs will be marked as 'skipped' to indicate that the test
        was not run due to it not being relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Up until just recently, CSS validation tests run against non-HTML and
        non-CSS URLs would show as having been completed with zero errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst this is technically correct it seems semantically less useful,
        somewhat similar to the difference between my car being certified as having
        zero faulty rocket boosters and my car being noted has being not applicable
        to rocket booster certification.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS validation tests for non-relevant content are now marked as 'skipped'
        instead of passing with zero errors.
