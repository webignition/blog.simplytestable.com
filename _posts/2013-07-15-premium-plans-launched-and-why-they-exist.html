    <h3>
        Premium Plans Launched
    </h3>    
    <p>
        Today I launched the initial range of <a href="http://simplytestable.com/plans/">premium plans</a>!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are four premium plans from which to choose, each varying in
        the monthly subscription price, the number of URLs that can be
        tested at one time and the number of credits available.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'll explain about credits and how they came to be in a near-future post.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For now I'm just here to let you know these exist. I'm not trying
        to sell you anything. Take a look at the <a href="http://simplytestable.com/plans/">plans
        and pricing</a> page for further details.

    <h3>
        Why These Premium Plans Exist
    </h3>
    <p>
        I'll be honest, it's the money. The premium plans exist to make money.
    </p>
    <p>
        But it's not <em>just</em> about the money. 
    </p>   
    <p>
        I can't run the service for free indefinitely. There are server costs
        that are not insignificant.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Mostly there is me cost. To be able to continue to build out the service
        to make it ever more valuable I need time. That's time that would
        otherwise be spent working as an employee or contracting as a
        consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I'm to continue to build out the service to make it ever more valuable
        to you, I need for the service to make money so that I can pay the costs
        of living.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's also about the value.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm building a service that is valuable. The value comes purely
        from time saved, where you can carry out in minutes what would take
        you hours.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Translate those hours saved into productive time and you can
        easily see how using Simply Testable to carry out tedious
        web testing will help you in your business make more money and
        provide even more value to your users and clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        That value to you in time saved can be translated into a monthly
        subscription fee that seems a very fair trade. And the revenue
        generated from your monthly subscription fee helps me pay the bills
        and allows me to continue to provide the service that then saves
        you money.        
    </p>
    <p>
        So, it works out well for both of us.
