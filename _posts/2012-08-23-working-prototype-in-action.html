    <p>
        A quick demonstration of the latest working prototype running a site-wide
        HTML validation test.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can see the test progress bar in the middle of the page and below
        that, not very clearly, you can see the changing test task queues.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this case we're testing a site that has 10 URLs and so we have 10 test
        tasks to run.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each task starts out as being <em>queued</em>: it's been created and it's impatiently
        waiting to be assigned to a worker. The yellow bar indicates how many
        queued tasks there are.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When assigned to a worker, a task is <em>in progress</em>. The blue bar
        in the video indicates how many tasks are in progress. This bar tends to grow
        as the number of queued tasks drops.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When finished, a task is marked as <em>completed</em>. That's the green bar.
