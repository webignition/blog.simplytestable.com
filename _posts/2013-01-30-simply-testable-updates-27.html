        Highlights from this week:
    </p>   
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Further Reduced Duplicated Data</strong>
            <p>
                Removed non-essential JavaScript static analysis result details,
                reducing the full database backup size from about 10 gigabytes to 
                about 200 megabytes and reducing the database backup size to 
                about 2% of what it was.
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <strong>Web Client Database Entirely Rebuildable</strong>
            <p>
                The web client at http://gears.simplytestable.com stores for 
                performance reasons a copy of test results that you access through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can now restore its database from the core application, making
                a backup of the database non-essential.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Working Towards a Stable Backup Strategy</strong>
            <p>
                The high-level backup strategy is ready and changes are being
                implemented to make it work.
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <strong>Updating the System to be Put Into a Read-only Mode</strong>
            <p>
                Work has started on updating the worker applications to allow them 
                to safely enter a read-only state.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>

        so no new newsletters for a couple of weeks.
    </p>
