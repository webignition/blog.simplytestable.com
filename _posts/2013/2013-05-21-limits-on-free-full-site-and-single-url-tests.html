        Limits are starting to be applied for totally free full-site and single-URL
        tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        At present there are limits on the number of full-site tests you can
        run per website per month. Similarly there are limits on the number of
        single-URL tests you can run per URL per month.
    </p>

    <p>
        These apply only if you have not signed in.
    </p>

    <p>
        Full-site tests are limited to 10 per website per month:

    <p>
        The above limit of 10 is not set in stone and is likely to vary over
        the next few weeks.

    <p>
        You will need to create an account or sign in to run further tests.
