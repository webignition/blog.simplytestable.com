<div class="section">
    <p>
        When performing a <a href="http://gears.simplytestable.com/">single-URL or full-site CSS validation</a>, you can choose
        to ignore CSS validation errors from chosen domains.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is useful if you link to third-party CSS resources through a common
        content delivery network; you can ignore CSS validation issues
        for resources over which you have no control.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each result collected from the CSS validator, the URL of the CSS
        resource to which the result relates is checked. If the domain in the URL
        is on the list of domains you have chosen to ignore the result will then
        be ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        This process was recently failing for one specific URL being tested.
    </p>

    <p>
        The URL of the stylesheet was very similar to the above illustration. Notice
        anything wrong with the markup in the illustration?
    </p>

    <p>
        Bonus points if you notice that the Content-Type meta element is present twice
        but, no, that's not the answer I'm looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Someone is developing on Windows?", you guess. No, that's not it either.
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer I'm looking for here is that the CSS resource uses a <code>file://</code>
        URL to reference a file on the local file system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such a URL won't work on the Internet, which will likely adversely affect the given
        page's appearance, but that's irrelevant to us as the markup is valid.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem is that a local <code>file://</code> URL contains no domain
        (no hostname).
    </p>

    <p>
        If, like us, you're checking the domain in a URL against a list of domains
        that you want to ignore, you're might well run into problems if a given
        URL doesn't contain a domain and if you'd not expected this to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that's exactly what happened and it's that exact case that I've just
        fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to now use valid but somewhat silly local URLs to reference
        stylesheets. It's a bad idea if you want your page to work on the Internet
        but at least it'll no longer break our CSS validation process.
    </p>
