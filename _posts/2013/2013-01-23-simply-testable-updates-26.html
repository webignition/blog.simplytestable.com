    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, January 30 2013.
    highlights:
        - Single URL (as well as full-site tests) now supported
        - Service was restored from the dead following the failure of both hard drives in the production server
        - Much of the data relied on for performance reasons will soon be reconstructable hence requiring no backup
        - General backup strategy overview
