<div class="section">
    <p>
        I've finished putting in place limits on free demo tests.  I'd like to
        explain what free demo tests are and the limits that apply to them.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a free demo test</h3>

    <p>
        If you're using Simply Testable to run a full-site HTML validation,
        CSS validation or JSLint analysis without being signed in you're running
        a free demo test.
    </p>

    <p>
        Free demo tests are available to everyone but are limited either in
        the number that can be run each month or are limited in the breadth of
        what is tested.
    </p>

    <p>
        This allows you to get an understanding of the tools we offer without
        adversely affecting the performance and quality of service provided
        to those who have accounts.
    </p>

    <h3>Breadth limits</h3>

    <p>
        Free demo tests are limited to the first 10 URLs discovered for a site.
        You get to run our full set of tests but can only do so for the first
        10 URLs.
    </p>

    <h3>Number of tests that can be run</h3>

    <p>
        Full-site tests are limited to 10 per website per month and
        single-URL tests are limited to 10 per URL per month.
    </p>

    <p>
        Examples of both of these were covered recently in
        <a href="/limits-on-free-full-site-and-single-url-tests/"><i>Limits on Free Full-Site and Single-URL Tests</i></a>.
    </p>
