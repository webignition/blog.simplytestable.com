    <p>
        I wrote recently about the newly-launched
        <a href="premium-plans-launched-and-why-they-exist/">premium plans</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I didn't mention is that all plans come with a 30 day free
        trial.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I also didn't mention is that until 31 July 2013 everyone is
        entitled to a 365 day free trial (a whole year) instead of the regular
        30 day free trial.
    </p>

    <p>
        This allows you to try out any premium plan for a whole year without
        having to pay anything or hand over any credit or debit card details.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can switch plans as often as you like during this time.
