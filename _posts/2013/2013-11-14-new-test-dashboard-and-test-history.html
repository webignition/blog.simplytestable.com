    <h3>Our New Test Dashboard and Test History Launched!</h3>

    <p>
        From day one the main focus of the service was on letting you run full-site
        tests that always worked.

        A couple of weeks ago, around a year after
        the MVP launch, it did. The service works, all the time, for any website <sup><a href="#footnote">*</a></sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The introduction of the new test dashboard and test history page starts
        a new phase of access to and analysis of test results to add further
        value to what Simply Testable provides.
    </p>

    <p>
        See the <a href="https://gears.simplytestable.com/">test dashboard</a> for yourself. If you're not signed in
        you'll see the demo account dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a quick (15 second) video showing the dashboard for my account in action as
        a test is carried out:

    <h3>Full Test History</h3>

    <p>
        The test dashboard previously contained, for signed in users, a list of
        recent tests. You could access the nine most recent tests that you had
        run. You could still access any past test if you knew the right URL and
        I suspect the number of people who kept track of the right URL was
        absolutely zero. It wasn't very useful.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new test history page lists all the tests you've ever run. Ten
        tests are displayed per page with the newest at the top of the list.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the <a href="https://gears.simplytestable.com/history/">test history page</a> itself or
        see below how the demo account test history appeared a few minutes ago:

        </a>
    </div>

    <p>
        Each listed test provides a summary showing you details including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>number of URLs tested</li>
        <li>number of tests run</li>
        <li>total number of errors</li>
        <li>total number of warnings</li>
        <li>number of errors per test type</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You no longer have to make a note of the URL for a given test should
        you want to re-visit the results at a later date!

    <h4>Footnote</h4>
    <p>
        When I say the service works <em>all the time, for any website</em>,
        I'm talking in general terms. There will always be something
        that doesn't work or something that can't be tested but the chances
        of you running across such a case is very, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compare this to a year ago where you'd be hard pressed to find a full-site
        test that wouldn't get stuck at one point or another.
