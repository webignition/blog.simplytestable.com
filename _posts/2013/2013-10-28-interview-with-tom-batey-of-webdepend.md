To help figure out how people who make and test websites go through the process
of testing websites, I'm interviewing people who make and test websites.
It's a crazy idea.

If you make or test websites and want to help shape tools built
to make your life easier, drop me an email
[&#106;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#105;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#98;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;](mailto:&#106;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#105;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#98;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;)
with the subject &ldquo;interview me&rdquo; to get things started.

I recently interviewed professional web tester [Tom Batey](https://twitter.com/TomBatey).

Find out how Tom and the company he owns and built test websites, the
tools they use and the approach taken to testing.

### Background

Tom owns and works for [WebDepend](http://www.webdepend.co.uk/),
a company dedicated to the testing of websites, built from the need for
what he experienced as lacking:

When I was a project manager delivering projects for clients I could
see that testing often had to be rushed and really needed dedicated
QA staff but there weren't any available so I decided this was a
route that was worth pursuing.

WebDepend provide professional testing services directly to site owners for
organisations including [David Lloyd Leisure](http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/),
[Jane Clayton &amp; Company](http://www.janeclayton.co.uk/),
[Cutler and Gross](http://www.cutlerandgross.com/) as well
as to digital agencies such as [OPX](http://www.opx.co.uk/)
and [Graymatter](http://www.graymatter.co.uk/).

Tom works on projects ranging from a few days to few months, depending
on the scope of the site being tested, covering both new sites and
regular re-testing of existing sites as changes are made.

### And That's The End of The Interview

I'd like to thank Tom for both taking his time to answer my questions
and for the valuable insights the answers provide.

The more people I can talk to on these subjects, the better Simply Testable
can be for those who need to test websites.
