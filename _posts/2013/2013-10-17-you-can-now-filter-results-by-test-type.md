See that list of error counts towards the right-hand side above?

That was just a simple plain list until a few minutes ago.

That simple plain list is now a set of clickable links, letting you
filter test results by the types of test that were selected.

You can now list all tests that were run, or just HTML validation
tests, or just CSS validation tests, or just JavaScript static analysis
tests or just link integrity tests.
