    closing_sentence: Expect the next newsletter a week from now on August 21.
    highlights:
        - crawling a site to find URLs to test
        - updating the worker applications to add a URL discovery task
        - updating the core application to farm out URL discovery tasks to the workers
        - updating the core application to re-start a test that previously failed due to there being no sitemap with the URLs discovered during the crawl
