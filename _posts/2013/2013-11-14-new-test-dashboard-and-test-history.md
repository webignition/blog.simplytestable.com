### Our New Test Dashboard and Test History Launched!

From day one the main focus of the service was on letting you run full-site
tests that always worked.

A couple of weeks ago, around a year after
the MVP launch, it did. The service works, all the time, for any website <sup>[*](#footnote)</sup>.

The introduction of the new test dashboard and test history page starts
a new phase of access to and analysis of test results to add further
value to what Simply Testable provides.

See the [test dashboard](https://gears.simplytestable.com/) for yourself. If you're not signed in
you'll see the demo account dashboard.

Here's a quick (15 second) video showing the dashboard for my account in action as
a test is carried out:

### Full Test History

The test dashboard previously contained, for signed in users, a list of
recent tests. You could access the nine most recent tests that you had
run. You could still access any past test if you knew the right URL and
I suspect the number of people who kept track of the right URL was
absolutely zero. It wasn't very useful.

The new test history page lists all the tests you've ever run. Ten
tests are displayed per page with the newest at the top of the list.

Take a look at the <a href="https://gears.simplytestable.com/history/">test history page</a> itself or
see below how the demo account test history appeared a f    ew minutes ago:

</a>

Each listed test provides a summary showing you details including:

- number of URLs tested
- number of tests run
- total number of errors
- total number of warnings
- number of errors per test type

You no longer have to make a note of the URL for a given test should
you want to re-visit the results at a later date!

### Footnote

When I say the service works *all the time, for any website*,
I'm talking in general terms. There will always be something
that doesn't work or something that can't be tested but the chances
of you running across such a case is very, very low.

Compare this to a year ago where you'd be hard pressed to find a full-site
test that wouldn't get stuck at one point or another.
