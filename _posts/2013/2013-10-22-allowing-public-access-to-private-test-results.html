    <h3>The Need To Share Test Results</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/TomBatey">Tom Batey</a> of <a href="http://www.webdepend.co.uk/">WebDepend</a>,
        recently <a href="mailto:&#106;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#105;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#98;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">contacted me by email</a>
        with some feature requests that would make his life as a professional
        web tester easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        One such request relates to sharing private test results:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        [I'd like to have] some way of adding issues into bug trackers or perhaps be able to add a results URL to a bug tracker so that it is accessible by someone who doesn't have a Simply Testable account.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I thought this was an excellent idea and when I'd cleared <a href="http://local.blog.simplytestable.com/awesome-link-integrity-testing-now-available/">link integrity testing</a>
        from my workload I set about making this happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Psst. <a href="#feature-requests">Need a feature?</a>)

    <h3>Unlocking Private Test Results</h3>
    <div class="illustration-inline illustration-inline-test-locked">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xbBDHkf.png" class="img-responsive" />
        <span class="illustration-highlight"></span>
    </div>
    <p>
        Tests that you run when signed in are private and can be accessed
        only by you. The fact that a test is locked to your account
        can now be seen below the re-test button when viewing the main
        test results.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is generally a good default as you might not want the whole
        world to know what you're working on.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to share private test results with colleagues or clients,
        just click the unlock button show above.
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll now see that your test is unlocked and the results can be viewed
        by anyone. You then have the option to lock the test again if you
        no longer want to be able to share the results:
    </p>

    <div class="illustration-inline illustration-inline-test-locked">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dSLNTlo.png" class="img-responsive" />
        <span class="illustration-highlight"></span>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Viewing Unlocked Test Results</h3>
    <p>
        Just share the main results URL or the results URL for any of the
        individual test results with whoever you want to be able to see
        the results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's what that will look like to anyone but you:
    </p>
    <div class="illustration-inline illustration-inline-test-locked">
        <a href="https://gears.simplytestable.com/http://blog.simplytestable.com//10865/results/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZEDPPXb.png" class="img-responsive" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Click the above image to be taken to an unlocked test that I just
        carried out myself.
