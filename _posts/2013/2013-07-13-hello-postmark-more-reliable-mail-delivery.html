    <h3>
        Moving to More Reliable Mail Delivery
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Simply Testable applications send a few commonplace transactional
        emails such as password reset reminders and account creation confirmations.
    </p>

    <p>
        I initially sent such mail through the SMTP services of a shared hosting service I run.
    </p>

    <p>
        To begin with, this was fine. It took all of a few minutes to set up,
        I knew it worked and it gave me server-level access to mail logs that
        allowed me to verify that mail was going where it should when it should.
    </p>

    <p>
        This worked fine until it didn't.

    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
        Well crap.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some people maintain lists of mail server IP addresses they think are
        naughty and other people who run mail services might use such lists to
        decide whether or not to accept mail from SMTP servers on such lists.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter how good your intentions, if you run a shared hosting service
        you will periodically run into bad people who use your services to send spam.
        You catch such matters, clear up the mess and continue on your way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except in this case there is one blacklist that continues to list my
        SMTP server's IP no matter what I do.
    </p>
    <p>
        This might be right, this might be wrong. I can do nothing either way.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've failed to receive an account creation confirmation email or a
        password reset email this may well be why.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I can do is move to sending Simply Testable transactional emails
        through a more reliable service.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>
        Hello <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        As of a few minutes ago, all Simply Testable transactional emails
        are being sent using <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had to jump through some hoops to verify the sender's address. This
        makes me confident that people are highly unlikely to use Postmark to
        send spam and as such it should be a highly reliable delivery mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
        And with premium plans just round the corner, we'll also be sending
        emails telling you if a subscription payment failed and that's too
        important to risk getting lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of you won't notice anything different but overall I'm glad to have
        increased by just a little the quality of service. That can't be a bad
        thing.
    </p>
