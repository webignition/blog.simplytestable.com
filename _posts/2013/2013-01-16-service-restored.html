        The recent <a href="/down-for-emergency-maintenance">emergency maintenance</a>
        is now all complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary: both hard disks in the production server failed resulting in all
        data being lost.
    </p>

    <p>
        The service has been restored to normal, however all past test results
        were lost in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the coming weeks I'll examine how to backup a significant subset of
        past test data so that we're able to restore your tests should we again
        encounter a major hardware failure.
