The recent [emergency maintenance](/down-for-emergency-maintenance) is now all complete.

In summary: both hard disks in the production server failed resulting in all data being lost.

The service has been restored to normal, however all past test results were lost in the process.

In the coming weeks I'll examine how to backup a significant subset of
past test data so that we're able to restore your tests should we again
encounter a major hardware failure.
