    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, January 16 2013.
    highlights:
        - CSS validation now skipped for non-relevant content
        - Improved detection of CSS validation vendor extension issues (so as to ignore them)
        - JS static analysis test results cached for linked JS resources
        - HTML validation now correctly ignores the case of a doctype declaration when checking if it is valid
        - HTML validation doctype checking works correctly if you have a UTF-8 BOM present
