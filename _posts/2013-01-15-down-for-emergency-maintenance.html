        Long test running with smartctl, will finish in about 4 hours.

        I'm unable to copy the MySQL data file for backup, some parts of the data
        file are on unreadable parts of the hard disk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'll run a full disk test.

    <h3>Original post</h3>
    <p>
        I've had to take the service down for emergency maintenance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I noticed a couple of hours ago that the MySQL server was stuck trying
        to read data from the disk. This is never a good sign.
    </p>
    <p>
        After stopping all Simply Testable services and trying to restart MySQL
        I saw that MySQL was failing to start due to it being unable to read
        its data files. This is never a good sign.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A reboot of the production server followed by some quick hard disk tests
        allowed the data files to be read once again. This was a bit promising.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'm currently in the process of compressing (zipping) the MySQL data files
        so that I can easily retrieve a backup.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Once the MySQL data file backup has been safely retrieved I'll run some
        in-depth hard disk tests to identify whether the hard disk is in immediate
        risk of failing. If so it will need replacing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'll keep the service down until I can determine if a hard disk replacement
        is needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I expect the database download to take some hours with the resulting
        full hard disk test taking a few hours longer still.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'll update this post when more is known.
