        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&id=807f34e4d2">twelfth updates newsletter</a> went out today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is the public launch day, where I start some form of promotion of the service:
    </p>

<ul>    
	<li>
            <p>
                I submitted a 'Show HN' post to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4636135">Hacker News</a>. It didn't garner much interest but
                it did receive a comment from someone I don't know which was very valuable.
            </p>
        </li>        
	<li>
            <p>
                The service was reviewed by a <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">group of ex-colleagues</a> who promptly caused widespread breakage.
            </p>
        </li>   
	<li>
            <p>
                I submitted the service to be listed at <a href="http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/">webresourcesdepot.com/</a>. 
                A competitor is listed there and so I thought I'd try the same.
            </p>
        </li>           
</ul>
    
    <p>
        Expect the next in a week from now, October 17 2012.
    </p>
