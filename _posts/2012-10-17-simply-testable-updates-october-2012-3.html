        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&amp;id=ade3a6e363">thirteenth updates newsletter</a> went out today.

  Friday saw us <a href="http://simplytestable.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&amp;id=cfad413d3f&amp;e=ff3884a0bf">featured at webreourcesdepot.com</a>. This brought in about 8x the previous traffic numbers and more or less killed
    the service.
            </p>

  Sunday saw us featured in <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/257467663071203328">a tweet from @smashingmag</a>,
    bringing in about 4x Friday's traffic, most certainly killing the service.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
The start of this week was a constant effort to kill off long-running tests to
    bring load down and examine how to stabilise the service.
            </p>
        </li>          
	<li>
            <p>
Yesterday saw the deployment of batch task assignment, reducing the number of
    Apache processes needed.
            </p>
        </li>        
	<li>
            <p>
Today saw the switch from Apache to Nginx, bringing the service back up to
    speed even under high load.
            </p>
        </li>      
</ul>
    
    <p>
        Expect the next in a week from now, October 24 2012.
