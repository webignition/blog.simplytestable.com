        Timeouts. Sometimes they just happen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Up until very recently, a timeout when trying to perform a HTML validation
        test for a URL would leave the test stuck as being in progress. This
        prevented the full site-wide test from ever showing as 100% complete, often
        getting stuck at 90-something percent.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Timeouts join a collection of three new test failure situations supported:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Retrieval timeouts: a timeout when retrieving the HTML of a page
                when trying to test it
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                DNS lookup timeouts: a timeout when trying to resolve the domain
                of a URL
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <p>
                Malformed URLs: sometimes a URL can't work as it is just not
                quite made correctly
            </p>
        </li>        
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        In any of the above three cases a test will be marked as failed and when
        viewing the results of a test you'll get a brief description of why
        the test could not happen.
