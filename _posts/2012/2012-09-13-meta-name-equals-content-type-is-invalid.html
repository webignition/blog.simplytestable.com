    <p>
        In investigating <a href="/production-bug-001-fixed/">production bug #001</a>
        I noticed some web pages were trying to specify the character encoding
        used but were doing so incorrectly.
    </p>

    <p>
        The character encoding for any resource retrieved over HTTP can be specified
        through the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header. This tells whatever
        retrieves a resource, such as a web browser, how to understand and
        interpet what it has received.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can choose to override what character encoding information may be present
        in the headers of an HTTP response by setting one of two <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>
        elements in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. This is useful if you have
        no control over the HTTP headers being returned and where those headers
        are incorrect.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to state that you are using <code>utf-8</code> as the character
        encoding, you can opt for either <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</code>
        or <code>&lt;meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='Type=text/html; charset=utf-8'&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        Some web pages choose instead to go for <code>&lt;meta name='Content-Type' content='Type=text/html; charset=utf-8'&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        It's quite an easy mistake to make but one that could badly impact how
        your page renders in browsers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Specify the character encoding incorrectly and it could be entirely up to a
        browser to choose how to understand what any fancy characters mean.
        Currency symbols such as &pound; and &euro; as well as accented characters
        such as &acirc; could be rendered correctly or instead could be rendered
        as a pair of out-of-place accented characters. You will control how such
        characters appear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Watch out for close-but-not-quite-right <code>meta</code> elements
        in your HTML documents. It's an easy one to get wrong.
