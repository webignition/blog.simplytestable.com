People have nice things to say about Simply Testable!    
    
I added today to the footer of [simplytestable.com](https://simplytestable.com/)
some of the love that's been received so far from [@jenko](https://twitter.com/jenko/)
and [Matcha Labs](http://matchalabs.com/).  
    
Have you tried Simply Testable and found it useful? Do you think it's a great idea and something
you'd find valuable? 
    
Let us know: send a tweet to [https://twitter.com/simplytestable](@simplytestable) 
or send an email to [&#106;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#105;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#98;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;](mailto:&#106;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#105;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#98;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;),
including, in addition to whatever you'd like to say, the link you'd like placed below
your quote.   
    
I can't try and buy your love and I definitely won't consider adding you to the list
of those getting free access to the subscription pro service coming in the next
few months. That absolutely will not happen.

    I like to validate a site before it goes live, but for large sites this is a pain. However, simplytestable takes the pain right out of it. Fire off the test, make yourself a cuppa and bickety bam! Your whole site validated.

    Simply Testable saves us time and effort when it comes to web testing and QA. It's quick to run, even on our larger sites, and the reports are invaluable. Simply Testable is now a regular part of our QA process.
