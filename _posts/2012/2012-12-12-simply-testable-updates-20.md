    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, December 19 2012.
    highlights:
        - This week has been entirely devoted to introducing CSS validation options
        - W3C online CSS validation provides 4 options, 2 of these are superfluous, 1 is confusing and the other is useful but limited
        - CSS validation errors for third-party CSS resources annoy me, so we let you ignore these if you like
        - CSS validation options (hopefully) going live this week
