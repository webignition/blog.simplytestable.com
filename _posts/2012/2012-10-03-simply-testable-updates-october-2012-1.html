    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, October 10 2012.
    highlights:
        - Performance improvements in preparation for today's <a href="https://simplytestable.com">public alpha release</a> release
        - Timeouts during tests are now caught; if the HTTP request to retrieve a web page for HTML validation times out, the test in question is marked as failed
        - ATOM and RSS feed URLs listed in robots.txt as the sitemap URL are now recognised, allowing URLs to be more easily collected for many WordPress, Blogspot and Blogger sites
        - 404 (not found) and 500 (internal server error) errors are now presented on nice error pages, I also get emailed a stack trace so that I know when something breaks and can then at least try to fix it
