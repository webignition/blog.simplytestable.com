    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, October 24 2012.
    highlights:
        - Friday saw us <a href="https://simplytestable.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&amp;id=cfad413d3f&amp;e=ff3884a0bf">featured at webreourcesdepot.com</a>. This brought in about 8x the previous traffic numbers and more or less killed the service.
        - Sunday saw us featured in <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/257467663071203328">a tweet from @smashingmag</a>, bringing in about 4x Friday's traffic, most certainly killing the service.
        - The start of this week was a constant effort to kill off long-running tests to bring load down and examine how to stabilise the service.
        - Yesterday saw the deployment of batch task assignment, reducing the number of Apache processes needed.
        - Today saw the switch from Apache to Nginx, bringing the service back up to speed even under high load.
