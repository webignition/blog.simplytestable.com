    <p>
        Account creation is now live! You can now <a href="http://gears.simplytestable.com/signup/">sign up for your free account</a>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>All full-site tests you start are private to you</strong><br />
                No-one else can view your tests, nor will they be listed on the Simply Testable
                homepage <a href="https://simplytestable.com/#recent-site-tests">list of recent tests</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Easily access past tests</strong><br />
                You get a list of recent tests, allowing you to see at a glance
                how well your tests are doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a vast improvement where previously you had to remember
                the URL for a test to come back to it later.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
