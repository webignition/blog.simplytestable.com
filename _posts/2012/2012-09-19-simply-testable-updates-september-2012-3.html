    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, September 26 2012.
    highlights:
        - "RSS feed support: for sites that have no sitemap.xml, URLs are retrieved from the RSS feed (if present)"
        - "Graceful test failure handling: URLs for which HTML validation cannot happen are marked as failed and no longer hold up the rest of the full-site test"
        - "Progress and results page improvements: these pages load almost always for larger (1500+ URL) sites, previously they failed most of the time"
