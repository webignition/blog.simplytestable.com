    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, October 31 2012.
    highlights:
        - Reconfiguring the MySQL server to use much more memory has reduced average query time from 0.2 seconds to 0.004 seconds
        - Account creation is underway, some of which is even working locally
        - People who make and test websites are using the service to test websites that they make and test (shocker!)
