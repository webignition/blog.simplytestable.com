    <p>
        I reached a significant milestone today: the first real test was run.
    </p>
    <p>
        I completed the integration of the W3C HTML validator (with HTML5
        support) into the <a href="https://github.com/webignition/worker.simplytestable.com/blob/master/src/SimplyTestable/WorkerBundle/Services/TaskDriver/HtmlValidationTaskDriver.php">worker HTML task driver</a>,
        an overly technical way of saying that HTML validation tests are
        now performing actual HTML validation and reporting the results back
        to the core application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The above illustration is a screenshot from a database administration tool
        showing the raw data for the test tasks for a completed test job run on
        the integration environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The column on the right shows the collection of HTML validator error
        messages formatted as a JSON document.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/illustrations/first-test-results-json-response/">A second illustration</a>
        shows the JSON output of the core application running in the integration
        environment complete with test results.
    </p>
    <p>
        The backend distributed test system is now carrying out real tests!
    </p>
    <p>
        I can now focus on building the frontend (which will eventually be at simplytestable.com)
        and see where that leads in time for the internal prototype milestone
        <a href="https://simplytestable.com/roadmap/">listed on the roadmap</a> as being next Wednesday.
