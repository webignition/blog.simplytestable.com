    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, October 17 2012.
    highlights:
        - Today is the public launch day, where I start some form of promotion of the service
        - I submitted a 'Show HN' post to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4636135">Hacker News</a>. It didn't garner much interest but it did receive a comment from someone I don't know which was very valuable.
        - The service was reviewed by a <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">group of ex-colleagues</a> who promptly caused widespread breakage.
        - I submitted the service to be listed at <a href="http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/">webresourcesdepot.com/</a>. A competitor is listed there and so I thought I'd try the same.
