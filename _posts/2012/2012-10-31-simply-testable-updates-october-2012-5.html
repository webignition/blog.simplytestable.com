    closing_sentence: Expect the next in a week from now, November 7 2012.
    highlights:
        - The service copes with capacity much better than it used to
        - I wrote today about how you can <a href="/how-to-test-a-local-site/">use Simply Testable to test a local site</a>
        - Account creation is mostly complete locally. Tests you start when logged in are private to you.
        - When retrieving URLs from compressed sitemaps, we no longer care what Content-Type accompanies the sitemap; HTTP headers lie.
