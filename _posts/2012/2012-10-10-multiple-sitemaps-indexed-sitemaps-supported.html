<div class="section">
    <p>
        The URLs to be tested when running a full-site test are gathered from a website's
        <a href="http://sitemaps.org/">sitemap</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A sitemap can list a collection of URLs for your site. A sitemap can also act as an index
        listing a collection of sitemaps. Your robots.txt file can also list many
        sitemaps (despite this not being part of the standard).
    </p>

    <p>
        Up until just a few minute ago, we supported only the first type: a sitemap
        that listed a collection of URLs for your site.
    </p>

    <p>
        I rewrote our <a href="https://github.com/webignition/website-sitemap-finder">sitemap finder</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/webignition/website-sitemap-retriever">sitemap retriever</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/webignition/sitemap-model">sitemap model</a> libraries to support
        mutilple sitemaps and sitemap indexes so that all sitemap uses are supported.
    </p>

    <p>
        If your robots.txt lists a sitemap index URL, we'll now read the index and read in all
        the referenced sitemaps and extract all URLs across all sitemaps for testing.
    </p>

    <p>
        If your robots.txt lists multiple sitemaps and are not using a sitemap index, we'll
        just grab all those sitemaps and extract all the URLs across all sitemaps for testing.
    </p>
