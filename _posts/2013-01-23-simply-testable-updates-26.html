        Our <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ac75e33d993d2b502e333ddd0&id=81832905c9">26th updates newsletter</a> went out today.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Highlights from this week:
    </p>   
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Single URL (as well as full-site tests) now supported
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <p>
                Service was restored from the dead following the failure of
                both hard drives in the production server
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Much of the data relied on for performance reasons will soon
                be reconstructable hence requiring no backup
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <p>
                General backup strategy overview
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>        
        Expect the next in a week from now, January 30 2013.
