<div class="section">    
    <p>
        Today I spotted a second case where an HTML validation test doesn't
        complete properly - redirect loops.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A redirect loop occurs when a URL that issues a <code>301</code>, 
        <code>302</code> or <code>303</code>
        redirect to another URL (perhaps back to the previous URL) in such a way
        that an unending loop of redirects is created.        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This can never be intended for any meaningful website; a redirect loop
        is a problem that should be addressed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our HTTP client library happily follows redirects and has a redirect limit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What we don't yet have in the testing system is a means of spotting
        that the HTTP client has reached its redirect limit and marking the test
        as failed as a result.
    </p>   

    <p>
        Production bug #002 spotted.
