  questions_and_answers:
    - question: "Are you primarily a developer who carries out testing while developing, or a dedicated tester?"
      answer: "I am a dedicated tester and have some development knowledge but not
               really enough to actually develop anything. I've been in the industry
               for over 15 years, mostly working in different roles in digital
               agencies throughout that time from Account Manager, Project Manager
               and even Account Director plus I ran my own small agency for a few years."
    - question: "What size team do you work in? How many other developers, testers and so on do you interact with on a daily basis?"
      answer:
        - "At WebDepend there are 2 of us full time and then we bring in further
           freelance testers as we need them."

        - "We generally interact with project managers, developers and other QA
           staff but, depending on the client, can sometimes also work with business
           owners, Marketing or IT teams."

        - "For most of the projects we work on there are no other testers involved
           and so we are working alongside project managers and reporting issues
           to developers."
- section: "Items To Test"
  questions_and_answers:
    - question:
        - "When carrying out functional testing, and aside from checking whether a specific
           functional area works as required, what do you check for?"

        - "In other words, do you have something akin to a checklist of items that you look to test?"
      answer:
        - "For each project I will put together a test plan or a checklist of the areas that I need
           to cover. I also add to that further standard items that pretty much every web project
           should have, which will be a mixture of web standards, best practice and items that I
           believe mean a better quality website."

        - "I then run through that checklist on each browser and mobile device that we are including
           as part of the scope of the testing. So aside from testing whether something actually works
           correctly I am checking that the layout of items on the page, the styling of elements and
           the ability to use those elements is first of all correct and second is consistent across
           all the browsers I am testing."

        - "With responsive websites I am also checking that the website provides the correct layout
           depending on the device, screen size and orientation that I am testing on. Plus I check
           that any responsive elements, such as a swipeable image gallery, can be used correctly."

        - "As I test across each browser and each mobile device I'll also pick up areas that are
           confusing or difficult to use plus navigation items, headings or button labels that don't
           make sense or other areas that might frustrate the user. Some of these issues might not be
           bugs as such but I'll report anything that I believe could improve the website and make
           it better for the user."

        - "I will also spend some time carrying out exploratory testing and not referring to the
           checklist that I've prepared. I'll try and put myself in the mind of the user and carry
           out journeys that I think they will take, perform actions that they might perform and
           build in 'uncertainty' around the journey I'm performing. This imagines a user is not
           certain of the action they need to carry out, so they might click the back button or
           want to go back to the homepage or look for a sitemap or not fill in a form correctly or
           make a mistake. For example, on a travel website, if you search for hotel room availability
           between certain dates, can you start to proceed with a booking then backtrack and choose
           different dates? Some websites 'lose' their ability to remember what you searched for
           if you use the back button or do something unexpected."

        - "The amount of testing that we can do for each project will depend on the budget we've
           agreed with our client and I need to estimate this budget correctly and agree with the
           client how much testing will be carried out and what that testing will be made up of."

    - question: "Assuming you have a checklist of items that you look to test (this seems quite
                 common), which would you consider the highest priority such that it would block
                  a site from being related live (or which you'd advise should be fixed as soon
                  as possible if already live)?"
      answer:
        - "First of all, I need to make sure I can test an entire website and run through the full
           checklist of items. If I get halfway through the checklist and there is an issue that
           prevents me from completing the testing then that becomes a blocker and is the highest
           priority to fix at that point."

        - "Next on the list of priorities would be areas that are fundamental to the website. For
           an ecommerce site those fundamental areas would be to find a product, add it to the shopping
           basket and go through the checkout process. So can that fundamental user journey be carried
           out across all the browsers and mobile devices? I've found issues before where the layout
           breaks in a particular browser that means the Add to basket button doesn't work or the
           checkout process might be really frustrating to use on an iPhone for example. Those would
           be high priority issues to fix."

        - "Anything that cuts off a large amount of users from being able to carry out a fundamental
           task would be high priority. If something functionally works but is impossible on a particular
           device or in a specific browser then that could affect a large percentage of the traffic
           coming to the site. If there are big accessibility issues then those would also be high
           priority."

- section: "Tools Used"
  questions_and_answers:
    - question: "What tools do you use to examine the quality factors against which you're testing?
                 What tools are used for what tests?"
      answer:
        - "In terms of functional testing, I am pretty much entirely manual although I'm planning to
           use tools for some repeatable test cases where we might have an ongoing testing schedule
           for a client. For example, we're planning on using Selenium for a particular project to
           test a range of enquiry forms to make sure those forms can always be submitted every time
           the developers deploy a new release. We will still perform some manual tests but Selenium
           can repeat the same tests across a number of different web browsers so we don't have to
           carry out as many tests manually."

        - "Similarly, we have used an automated tool called Nimsoft Cloud User Experience Monitor
           (used to be Watchmouse) to test that specific user journeys are always working and also
           monitor the performance of those user journeys. So if the user journey was to find a product,
           add it to a basket and go to the checkout, we would use Nimsoft to run that every 15 minutes
           and continually monitor the performance of it. Nimsoft will send us alerts if one of the steps
           goes over a certain threshold and an investigation can then take place as to what is happening
           that might cause that step to suffer from poor performance or stop working altogether. It is a
           great early warning system for live websites."

        - "Another area I'm interested in is testing a website's SEO and I use tools from a company called
           Moz to scan a site and give me results showing me missing or duplicate title tags, meta descriptions
           and potential duplicate content problems, which are important for SEO but can also affect a user's
           experience of the site. For example, if every title tag is the same then that is not really helpful
           for users or for search engines."

        - "Then obviously I use Simply Testable to enable me to gain an appreciation of code quality and
           adherence to HTML and CSS standards."

    - question:
        - "Are there any aspects for which there are no tools to support you?"
        - "For example, you might check that a site has a custom 404 page instead of the default Apache 404 page,
           and you find you always have to check this by hand."
      answer:
        - "For me, the majority of what I test is manual and in my view should be manual. I want to use
           the website as a user would in order to understand the main issues and problems that a user
           would face, as well as test that functions are working in the way that they are supposed to
           work."

        - "I like to use automated tools that enable me to cover more of the website, especially large
           websites, and give me insight into areas that I've not been able to get to manually. This is
           not really functionality but a spell check of an entire website would be a good automated tool.
           There are some existing tools that check the spelling and grammar for a website already but
           none that I regularly use in my standard checklist yet."

        - "In terms of the 404 page example, I'll always want to manually check that a custom 404 page
           is in place because I also want to check how good it is. It isn't enough for there to be a
           custom 404 page, it should be helpful to the user and enable them to find what they were
           looking for or go back to the home page or contact someone who can help them."

- section: "Pain Points and One-Click Magic"
  questions_and_answers:
    - question:
        - "Are there any tests, relative to the project as a whole, that are a pain to carry out?"

        - "For example, an accessibility related test might concern checking that all images have sensible
           alt text and whilst a tool can tell you if image alt text is outright missing you find you still
           spend (far too much) time having to manually verify that alt text is not nonsense."
      answer:
        - "That is a key aspect between using automated tools and manual testing. On the whole, the tool
           will tell you if alt text is there or not but if the tool tells you that alt text is present it
           doesn't mean that the alt text is correct. Automated tools allow you to cover more ground and get
           further into the testing but you still need to go and look at the alt text, as you say, to make
           sure it makes sense and correctly describes the image."

        - "Another example is title tags, there are tools that tell you a title tag is missing and you can also
           get tools that tell you if a title tag is very short or is very long. But you still need to review
           the title tag and see if it makes sense and correctly describes the page."

        - "Generally, it is not possible to review all the title tags, meta descriptions, alt tags, etc.
           that there might be in a website so we have to prioritise our time and only review the most
           important pages whilst using tools such as Simply Testable to cover the whole site finding
           all the missing items or the broken links."

    - question: "&ldquo;I wish I had a button I could click that would do this for me automatically&rdquo; - what first
                 springs to mind, or what is the most significant thing that springs to mind, when reading that?"
      answer:
        - "Well, you've already built some of the features I requested for Simply Testable, which is great."

        - "Something we're doing more is to carry out basic tests to measure the performance of websites and
           being able to test items at a code level for a whole website would be great. So an automated test
           to check whether all images have been optimised as much as they can be or whether CSS and JS files
           have been minified and combined plus any other aspects of the code or images that could indicate
           potential performance improvements."
